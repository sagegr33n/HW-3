    "**Due Friday Oct. 25th @ 11:59 pm**\n",

    "**Regrade Request Due Date: Friday Nov. 8th @ 11:59 pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This assignment will give you experience with control flow, Numpy arrays and functions, datetimes, and basic plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions:**\n",
    "### Accessing Class Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download this notebook from the homework GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new folder in your JupyterHub server and name it `HW2`. Double click your new `HW2` folder to enter it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once the notebook is downloaded to your local computer, upload the notebook to your `HW2` folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Double click the `HW2.ipynb` notebook to open and start working on the assignment. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting to GradeScope\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your code fully runs before uploading to GitHub/Gradescope. The best way to do this is by restarting your kernel, running through each of your cells, and checking for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you're sure that your code fully runs, save your notebook file. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Upload your notebook to GitHub via SSH log in or manually uploading it to a new repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Go to the Homework 2 Assignment in Gradescope and sync your GitHub account to upload your notebook. If you are having trouble with this step, you can download your notebook from JupyterHub and manually upload it to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Autograder should run and will let you know if you have any errors. You can resubmit as many times as you want before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working in your Notebook   \n",
    "1. Read the instructions to each question and its subsections carefully, and make sure to write your answers in the *specified cells*. Typically, you will see an empty string (`\"\"`) in the places you need to fill in. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure to use the provided variable names in the starter code. The Autograder will check these given variables by running tests, so changes made to variable names will result in an Error and/or failed tests. An example is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To help you start thinking about how to write meaningful and concise variable names, we have provided variable names in most of your questions. For example, `pelagic` and `coastal` are variable names in Homework 1 Question 2a to describe different oceanic zones you will be comparing. <br>\n",
    "![Question_2a](https://i.ibb.co/Kzz7g9w/part-a.png)\n",
    "    Note that there is an empty string (`\"\"`) after each of the variable names. These are the sections you are expected to fill in. Please use the provided variable names (ie `pelagic` and `coastal` in the above example) to report your final answer back in. This will ensure that the autograder on Gradescope runs properly. <br>\n",
    "<br>**Make sure that you are adding comments as you go along! Part of your grade will include using best coding practices in your homework assignments.** \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The starter code is only meant to help you get started. You may write code and any other intermediary variables that can start before or after the starter code depending on the question. Just make sure your final answers are stored in the provided answer variables at the end! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Honor Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the assignment by writing and executing text and code cells as specified. For this assignment, do not use any features of Python that have not yet been discussed in the lessons or class sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please keep in mind our regrade request and dropped homework grading policy. Late assignments are not accepted. Review the syllabus for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can acknowledge and describe any assistance you've received on this assignment in the specified cell of the HW2 notebook, whether that was from an instructor, classmate (either directly or on Ed Discussion), and/or online resources. Alternatively, if you prefer, you may acknowledge assistance at the relevant point(s) in your code using a Python comment (#). Don't forget that you can receive extra credit from answering at least one question on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/67282)!"

    "# Question 1 - Numpy documentation (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more functions and packages in Python than we have discussed in class. It is important for data analysts to be able to independently **find**, **learn about**, and **apply** useful functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, peruse the online [Numpy library documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html) and select **three** functions to learn more about\\. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't forget to import numpy! You only have to do this _once_ for your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each Numpy function (10 points per function):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe what the function does. What value(s) does it return? <br>\n",
    "2. Describe at least *two* **positional** arguments used in the function. What data types are required for them? What order do they go in? <br>\n",
    "3. Describe at least *one* **optional** named argument used in the function. What data types are required for it? What is the default value?<br>\n",
    "4. Provide the link to the documentation page(s) you used to answer these questions.<br>\n",
    "5. Write a code snippet where you use the function and print the result.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: ```numpy.lcm```\n",
    "1. The function numpy.lcm finds and returns the lowest common multiple of the absolute value of the inputs.<br>\n",
    "2. The first two positional arguments used in numpy.lcm have to be either numpy arrays of integers or single scalar integers. An array or scalar of the lowest common multiple(s) of both arguments is returned by the function.<br>\n",
    "3. One optional argument is \"where\" which indicates whether a universal function should be calculated at this point. The data type required is a Boolean. \"where\" = True is the default value.<br>\n",
